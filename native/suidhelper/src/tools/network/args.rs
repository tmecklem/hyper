//! Pure `ip`/`nft` argv builders for per-VM egress networking.
//!
//! Each step is data — a [`Command`] naming which privileged binary runs it and
//! its exact argv — so the sequences below can be asserted in
//! `tests/tools/network_args.rs` without root or a real network device.
//! Execution (actually invoking the binaries) lands in Task 4; this module only
//! builds the argv.
//!
//! Laws (tested):
//! - `prepare_commands` creates the netns first, and only requests the in-netns
//!   default route after the host veth (`hv<slot>`) is brought up — the guest's
//!   route target must already be reachable when the route is added.
//! - `teardown_commands` always deletes the netns, which reclaims the ns-side
//!   veth peer, the TAP device, and any in-netns nftables state.
//! - `host_init_commands` masquerades the clone pool out the configured uplink,
//!   drops guest traffic addressed to the cloud metadata IP
//!   (`169.254.169.254`), and drops all clone-pool-sourced traffic addressed to
//!   the host itself on the INPUT hook (distinct from FORWARD — see that
//!   function's doc), so no VM can ever reach it or a host-local service.

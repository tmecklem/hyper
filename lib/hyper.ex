  Run `argv` inside VM `vm` — a pid (from `create_vm/1`) or a `Hyper.Vm.Id.t()`
  binary — and return its captured output.

  Cluster-routed: a pid resolves to its owning node directly (`node(pid)`); a
  vm_id resolves via the routing registry (`whereis/1`). The command runs on
  whichever node hosts the VM, via that node's `Hyper.Node.exec/3`.

  Returns `{:ok, %{stdout: binary(), stderr: binary(), exit_code: integer()}}`, or
  `{:error, reason}` — `:agent_unavailable` if the relay/agent is not yet
  reachable, `:timeout` if the gRPC deadline expired, `:not_found` if the VM
  cannot be resolved (unknown vm_id, or a pid whose id/owning node is gone),
  `:node_unreachable` if the owning node cannot be reached over the cluster.
  `opts`: `:env` (map `%{String.t() => String.t()}`), `:cwd` (string), `:timeout`
  (ms, gRPC deadline forwarded to the relay; default 30 000).

  `argv` is executed directly, not through a shell. Use an **absolute** `argv`
  head (`["/bin/echo", "hi"]`): the guest runs as PID 1 with a near-empty
  environment, and a non-empty `:env` *replaces* it entirely, so a bare command
  name has no `PATH` to resolve against and returns exit code 127.

  measures compute performed, not compute allocated, and is the billing
